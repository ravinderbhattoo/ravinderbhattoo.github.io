<i class="fa fa-desktop"></i> PeriDyn is a numerical simulation software designed to solve peridynamics problems. It is written in the Julia programming language, and offers a high level of flexibility and speed. PDBenchmark is built on top of the PeriDyn package, which provides a number of predefined material models and benchmark problems. This allows users to quickly set up and run simulations, and compare their results to established benchmarks. [link](https://ravinderbhattoo.github.io/PeriDyn/)
