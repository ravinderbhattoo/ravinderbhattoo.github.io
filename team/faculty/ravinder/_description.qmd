Hi! I’m Ravinder Bhattoo, assistant professor in the Department of <a href="https://ce.iiti.ac.in/">Civil Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://iiti.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Indore</a>. My research focus areas are machine learning-aided structural design, multiscale material modeling, physics-informed machine learning, graph neural networks, dynamic fracture and crack propagation on ballistic impact, molecular dynamics, and peridynamics. Previously, I have worked as a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of <a href="https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/civil-environmental-engineering/">Civil and Environmental Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> and as an early doc scholar in the Department of Civil Engineering at the <a href="https://home.iitd.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</a>. I earned my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in January 2023, and my B. Tech. in Civil Engineering from the <a href="https://www.iitr.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee</a> in June 2015. My Ph.D. research focused on data-driven modeling and physics-informed machine learning for glass discovery.
