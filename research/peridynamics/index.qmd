Peridynamics is a nonlocal continuum theory that can describe material failure and fracture without using the traditional concepts of stress and strain. Instead, it models a material as a collection of particles that interact through pairwise forces. These forces depend on the separation between particles, and can be used to simulate a wide range of materials, including brittle and ductile solids, fluids, and granular materials.
