### Health Monitoring of Railway Truss Bridges

The research aims to modernize the evaluation of railway bridge conditions within India’s extensive network. The dynamic landscape includes bridges over a century old, alongside modern rail demands characterized by increased axle loads and speeds. The Committee emphasizes modern tech integration for revolutionary inspections, paving the way for automated real-time health monitoring, enhancing safety and maintenance. The proposal aims to leverage physics-informed machine learning and proven data-driven approaches, as demonstrated in related tasks. The overarching objective is to establish a precise framework for structural health monitoring, effectively encompassing safety, maintenance, and technological progress
